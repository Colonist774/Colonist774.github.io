                    <h2>The Fallen Angel</h2>
                    <p>"The Fallen Angel" is a painting by French artist Alexandre Cabanel, painted in 1847. The painting depicts the Devil after falling from heaven. The angel, who was driven out of heaven by God, is depicted annoyed, with his arms crossed and a tear visible in the corner of his eye. He lies on the ground, naked, while other angels fly in the sky above him to show the glory of God.</p>
